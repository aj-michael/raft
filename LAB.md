# Messaging Systems Lab: <br/> Distributed Consensus with Raft

Adam Michael

February 3, 2016

In this lab you will explore the application of messaging systems to the design and construction of fault-tolerant, highly-available, eventually-consistent data systems.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab you will need to install [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html) and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Setup.html). If you prefer, you may use [Activator](https://www.typesafe.com/activator/download) instead of SBT. If you have not used Scala before, it is recommended that you read (or skim) through the [documentation](http://www.scala-lang.org/documentation/).
